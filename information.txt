Task: Create an AI that can generate a regex statement for a user

Training Data: A list of regexes that should match, a list of regexes that should not match, and the expected output. The input length will vary

Model Details:

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with attention mechanism
- Allows for variable sized input regex data
- Uses attention to focus on relevant parts of the input data
- Includes length regularization to prevent overfitting
Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- Takes the output of the RNN as input
- Predicts the output regex
- Includes a latent space to capture underlying patterns in the data
Training:

- Use the training data to train the RNN and VAE simultaneously
- The RNN is trained to predict the output regex, while the VAE is trained to learn the underlying patterns in the data
- Use a combination of reconstruction loss and KL divergence loss as the VAE loss function
- Use backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent to optimize the model weights
Evaluation:

- Use a test set to evaluate the performance of the model
- Calculate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's accuracy in generating regex statements
